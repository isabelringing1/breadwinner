## FAQ
### Tracking my activity across the entire browser is a little scary. How safe is the companion extension?

Bread Winner only counts the number of clicks and keystrokes you make in the browser, never what you actually do. Data is stored locally and does not leave your browser.

If you're still concerned, please feel free to check out the source code! It's publicly available [here](https://github.com/isabelringing1/click-counter-chrome) and [here](https://github.com/isabelringing1/click-counter-firefox).

### I still don't want to install an extension. Can I play?

Totally understandable! Yes, the game is completely beatable via Trial Mode.

### Are there only extensions for Chome and Firefox?

At the moment, yes. If you have a burning desire for a different browser, make it [known](https://forms.gle/XZsfyj8Vem2RhEYHA).

### I installed the extension. Why aren't my clicks being registered?

If you had a page open before installing, you'll need to refresh it to pick up any future clicks. Firefox users also need to open the extension to explictly allow permissions.

## Credits

I mean, if you've dug this far, you've been doing your research. So here's the story:

Bread Winner was my thesis project at [NYU ITP](https://itp.nyu.edu/itp/), under adviser Kari Love. I presented it during ITP Thesis Week in the Spring of 2024. 

The game has evolved a lot since that point, but if you're curious, here's the final presentation video:
